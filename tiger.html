        <h3>About Raja</h3>
        <p>Raja is our magnificent Bengal tiger, one of the most iconic and admired big cats in the world. He joined our zoo family in 2019 after being rescued from a forest area near the Sundarbans, where he was found injured and dehydrated. With care and attention, Raja made a full recovery and has become one of the most popular animals in our zoo.</p>

        <p>Raja’s striking orange coat with black stripes and his piercing amber eyes make him a favorite among visitors and photographers. He spends most of his day exploring his territory or relaxing near the pond in his enclosure. His presence commands respect and awe.</p>

        <p>He enjoys a protein-rich diet that includes beef, chicken, and special zoo-formulated meat portions. Raja eats once daily and consumes around 8–10 kg of meat. He drinks about 8 liters of water daily and prefers shaded spots during hot afternoons.</p>

        <p>Raja has a calm but observant nature. He is very alert to new scents and sounds in his surroundings. His caretakers describe him as “regal but playful,” especially during enrichment activities. His favorite enrichment involves chasing moving targets or scent trails created by the zookeepers.</p>

        <p>During cooler months, Raja becomes more active and is often seen patrolling his enclosure. His roars echo across the zoo in the early mornings, a sound that thrills visitors. Though solitary by nature, Raja interacts peacefully with his caretakers and responds to whistle commands during feeding time.</p>

        <p>Raja plays a vital role in raising awareness about tiger conservation. As Bengal tigers are endangered, he symbolizes the urgent need to protect their habitats from deforestation and illegal hunting. School groups often visit his enclosure to learn more about this majestic species.</p>

        <p>Veterinary checkups are done regularly to ensure his good health. Raja’s coat is shiny, his muscles are strong, and his weight is ideal. He undergoes routine dental care and enrichment exercises to keep both his body and mind active.</p>

        <p>Raja represents the power and beauty of the wild jungles of Asia. His story of rescue and recovery continues to inspire our visitors to care for wildlife and protect nature’s wonders.</p>
