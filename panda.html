            <h3>About Bao Bao</h3>
            <p>Bao Bao is one of the most adored residents of our zoo. She came to us in 2018 through an international panda conservation exchange program. Her calm and playful nature makes her a favorite among both visitors and caretakers.</p>

            <p>Native to the mountainous regions of China, Bao Bao enjoys a carefully recreated bamboo forest environment. She spends most of her day eating bamboo, resting on tree trunks, or rolling playfully in her enclosure.</p>

            <p>Pandas like Bao Bao have a very specialized diet — nearly 99% of it consists of bamboo. She consumes about 12–15 kg of bamboo daily, along with small portions of fruits such as apples and carrots for variety.</p>

            <p>Although she looks calm, Bao Bao can be surprisingly agile. She loves climbing small trees and playing with hanging logs and bamboo poles. During warm days, she relaxes in her shaded pool area.</p>

            <p>Bao Bao shares her enclosure with another panda, Ling Ling. They get along well and often nap close to each other. Pandas are mostly solitary by nature, but these two have formed a special friendship.</p>

            <p>She communicates using soft bleats and honks — sounds unique to pandas. Her caretakers describe her as gentle and intelligent, often responding to her name when called.</p>

            <p>During the winter months, Bao Bao enjoys sleeping longer hours. In summer, she stays cool by lying near the mist fans and shaded rocks placed in her habitat.</p>

            <p>As part of our conservation education program, Bao Bao helps raise awareness about the importance of protecting panda habitats and reducing deforestation. She has inspired thousands of visitors to learn more about wildlife conservation.</p>

            <p>Bao Bao receives regular health checkups to ensure her well-being. Her diet, activity levels, and overall health are closely monitored. She’s in excellent shape, with shiny fur and strong teeth — signs of a healthy and happy panda.</p>

            <p>Her gentle charm and playful behavior make Bao Bao a true ambassador for endangered species and one of the most loved animals in our zoo.</p>
