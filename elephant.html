        <h3>About Kavi</h3>
        <p>Kavi is one of the most beloved residents of our zoo. This majestic Asian elephant joined us in 2016 from a wildlife sanctuary in northern Thailand. Since his arrival, he has become a symbol of wisdom and strength, admired by visitors of all ages.</p>

        <p>Kavi is easily recognized by his long tusks and calm demeanor. He spends his mornings enjoying mud baths and his afternoons walking around his spacious enclosure. Elephants like Kavi are highly social, and he loves interacting with his caretakers and visitors from a safe distance.</p>

        <p>Kavi’s diet mainly includes fresh fruits, vegetables, and hay. He eats around 150 kg of food daily and drinks about 100 liters of water. His favorite treats are watermelons and sugarcane, which he skillfully peels with his trunk.</p>

        <p>He enjoys his daily enrichment sessions, which include moving logs, playing with large balls, and painting with non-toxic colors. These activities keep his mind and body active while encouraging natural behaviors such as foraging and problem-solving.</p>

        <p>Kavi communicates using a variety of low-frequency sounds and gentle rumbles. His caretakers say he’s very expressive and can even recognize them by their voices. During the summer, he loves cooling off under the sprinklers or taking a dip in the large pool inside his enclosure.</p>

        <p>Kavi plays a key role in our zoo’s conservation education program, helping visitors understand the threats Asian elephants face in the wild, such as habitat loss and illegal poaching. Through his story, thousands of children have learned about the importance of protecting these gentle giants.</p>

        <p>Veterinary checkups are done regularly to ensure his well-being. Kavi’s skin is kept healthy with regular baths and scrubbing. His tusks and feet receive routine care to prevent injuries and infections.</p>

        <p>Kavi’s gentle nature and intelligence make him a favorite among both visitors and staff. He represents the grace and power of Asia’s wildlife and reminds us of the beauty of coexistence between humans and nature.</p>
