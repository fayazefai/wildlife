            <h3>About Joey</h3>
            <p>Joey is one of our most active and friendly animals. He joined our zoo family in 2019 from a wildlife rescue center in Australia. Known for his powerful jumps and curious behavior, Joey loves exploring his enclosure and interacting with visitors from a safe distance.</p>

            <p>As a Red Kangaroo, Joey is the largest species of marsupial in the world. His reddish-brown fur glows beautifully under the sunlight, and his strong hind legs allow him to leap more than 9 meters in a single bound!</p>

            <p>Joey enjoys feeding on a variety of grasses and hay. He also loves occasional treats like carrots and apples, which are provided by his caretakers. His hydration is maintained with fresh water throughout the day.</p>

            <p>During the day, Joey can often be seen resting under shaded trees or relaxing near the water pond. He is most active during early mornings and late afternoons, when he hops around his area and plays with enrichment toys.</p>

            <p>Joey lives with two other kangaroos, Matilda and Skippy. They form a small group and enjoy social grooming and gentle play. Visitors love watching their synchronized movements and playful hops.</p>

            <p>In winter, Joey’s fur thickens slightly to keep him warm, and during hot summer days, he uses his forearms to cool off by licking them—a natural behavior seen in kangaroos to regulate body temperature.</p>

            <p>Joey is known for being very observant and alert. His large ears can rotate independently to detect sounds from different directions. His caretakers describe him as “curious but calm.”</p>

            <p>He plays an important role in our zoo’s educational programs, helping children learn about Australian wildlife, marsupial characteristics, and conservation efforts to protect natural habitats in the Outback.</p>

            <p>Joey receives regular veterinary checkups to ensure his excellent health. His strong muscles and clean fur indicate he’s thriving in his environment. His balanced diet and plenty of space to move around keep him happy and active.</p>

            <p>Joey truly embodies the spirit of the Australian wilderness and continues to delight visitors with his grace and energy every single day.</p>
