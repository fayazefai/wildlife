        <h3>About Zara</h3>
        <p>Zara is our elegant Masai giraffe, known for her tall frame and friendly nature. She joined our zoo family in 2020 from a wildlife conservation center in Tanzania. With her calm personality and long eyelashes, Zara has quickly become a favorite among visitors.</p>

        <p>Standing over five meters tall, Zara is one of the tallest animals in the zoo. Her distinctive spotted coat and graceful movements make her easy to recognize from afar. She spends most of her day browsing for leaves and interacting with her fellow giraffes.</p>

        <p>Zara eats around 30 kg of fresh leaves, vegetables, and hay daily. Her long tongue, which is about 45 cm, helps her pluck leaves from tall branches. She drinks water only once every few days, as most of her hydration comes from her leafy meals.</p>

        <p>Her enclosure includes tall acacia trees and elevated feeding stations designed to mimic her natural habitat. Zara enjoys reaching for food placed high up, which helps her maintain good posture and muscle strength.</p>

        <p>Zara has a very social nature and often spends time with her companion giraffes. She’s curious about people and sometimes walks close to the viewing deck, delighting children and families who visit her area.</p>

        <p>During summer, Zara enjoys staying under shaded trees or near the misting fans. In winter, she’s provided with warm shelters where she can rest comfortably. Her calm temperament makes her easy to work with, and she’s particularly gentle during veterinary checkups.</p>

        <p>As part of our zoo’s educational program, Zara helps teach visitors about giraffe conservation and the threats they face in the wild, such as habitat loss and poaching. Her presence reminds everyone of the beauty and fragility of Africa’s wildlife.</p>

        <p>Regular health checkups show that Zara is in excellent condition. Her coat is glossy, her eyes are bright, and her diet keeps her strong and active. She’s a living example of elegance and grace — truly the queen of the savanna at Zoo Park.</p>
