            <h3>About Simba</h3>
            <p>Simba is one of the most majestic animals in our zoo and has been a part of our family since 2018. He was born in the wilds of Tanzania and was rescued after his pride was found near a farming area. Since then, Simba has grown into a healthy, confident lion and is often seen resting proudly under the trees during the day.</p>

            <p>Simba’s thick golden mane makes him easily recognizable to visitors. His roar is one of the loudest in the park and can often be heard early in the morning. He is extremely protective of his area but shows a calm and relaxed behavior towards his caretakers.</p>

            <p>He enjoys his meals twice a day, usually consisting of beef, chicken, or specially prepared zoo diet meat. Simba drinks around 10 liters of water per day and loves spending time near the small pond in his enclosure.</p>

            <p>Simba shares his area with two lionesses, Nala and Zuri. He is the leader of their small pride. Although he appears fierce, Simba is known to be gentle with cubs and often allows them to play around him.</p>

            <p>During summer, Simba prefers resting in shaded spots or inside his cave area. In winter, he enjoys basking in the sunlight. He is very active during feeding time and occasionally responds to his keeper’s whistle.</p>

            <p>Simba’s caretakers describe him as intelligent and observant. He reacts quickly to any new sounds or movements in his enclosure. His favorite enrichment activity is chasing a hanging meat ball, which keeps him fit and entertained.</p>

            <p>As part of our zoo’s conservation program, Simba also helps raise awareness about wild lion protection and the importance of saving their natural habitats. His story has inspired many school children and visitors to learn more about African wildlife.</p>

            <p>Veterinary checkups are done every six months. Simba’s health is excellent — his fur is shiny, teeth are strong, and his appetite is steady. His diet is carefully monitored to ensure proper nutrition and weight control.</p>

            <p>Simba represents the strength and pride of the African savannah. He continues to be one of the most loved animals in our zoo, admired by thousands of visitors every year.</p>
