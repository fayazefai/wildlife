                <div class="about-text">

                    <p>Welcome to <strong> Zoo Park</strong>, one of the most loved and respected wildlife parks in the region.</p><br>

                    <p>Our zoo was officially established in <strong>1995</strong> with a vision to create a safe and natural home for animals while providing visitors with an opportunity to learn about the beauty of wildlife.</p><br>

                    <p>What began as a small community project with a few local species has grown into a world-class zoological park spread over <strong>120 acres</strong> of lush green land.</p><br>

                    <p>From the beginning, our goal has been simple — to protect endangered species, promote conservation, and inspire a love for animals in people of all ages.</p><br>

                    <p>Over the years, the zoo has evolved into a home for more than <strong>1,500 animals</strong>, representing over <strong>180 species</strong> from across the globe.</p><br>

                    <p>You can find majestic lions, playful monkeys, graceful giraffes, colorful birds, powerful elephants, and fascinating reptiles — all living in carefully designed natural habitats.</p><br>

                    <p>The founders, <strong>Mr. Gold Smith</strong> and <strong>Mrs. Gold Smith</strong>, envisioned a zoo where animals could thrive in large, open enclosures that resemble their native environments.</p><br>

                    <p>With a small team of passionate wildlife experts, they transformed an empty piece of land into a living sanctuary for animals and a center of learning for people.</p><br>

                    <p>Today, <strong>Zoo Park</strong> continues their legacy by balancing recreation with education and conservation.</p><br>

                    <p>Each exhibit in our zoo is designed with animal comfort and environmental enrichment in mind.</p><br>

                    <p>Our habitats feature trees, ponds, rocks, caves, and open grasslands that mimic the wild.</p><br>

                    <p>We believe that animals should live as close to nature as possible, even in captivity, to ensure their physical and mental well-being.</p><br>

                    <p>The zoo also runs multiple <strong>conservation programs</strong>, focusing on endangered species such as the <strong>Bengal tiger</strong>, <strong>African lion</strong>, <strong>snow leopard</strong>, and <strong>Asian elephant</strong>.</p><br>

                    <p>Our breeding center, established in <strong>2002</strong>, has successfully raised several rare species that are later reintroduced into protected reserves.</p><br>

                    <p>We collaborate with wildlife organizations, environmental NGOs, and government agencies to promote biodiversity conservation.</p><br>

                    <p>In addition to animal exhibits, <strong>Zoo Park</strong> features several educational and recreational facilities for visitors.</p><br>

                    <p>These include a <strong>Wildlife Education Center</strong>, <strong>Animal Interaction Zone</strong>, <strong>Kids’ Adventure Park</strong>, <strong>Bird Aviary</strong>, <strong>Reptile House</strong>, <strong>Butterfly Garden</strong>, and <strong>Safari Train Ride</strong>.</p><br>

                    <p>Our goal is not just to entertain but to educate — every visitor leaves with a better understanding of how precious and delicate our planet’s ecosystems are.</p><br>

                    <p>Our team includes veterinarians, zoologists, caretakers, nutritionists, and volunteers who work around the clock to ensure the animals’ health and happiness.</p><br>

                    <p>They monitor feeding, training, enrichment, and medical checkups every day.</p><br>

                    <p>The zoo hospital is equipped with modern diagnostic tools, an operating theater, and quarantine areas for new arrivals.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Zoo Park</strong> also focuses on sustainability.</p><br>

                    <p>We recycle waste, use solar-powered lighting in some areas, and plant over <strong>500 new trees</strong> every year.</p><br>

                    <p>Our visitors are encouraged to participate in eco-friendly activities such as <strong>“Adopt an Animal”</strong> programs and weekend clean-up drives.</p><br>

                    <p>The zoo officially opened to the public on <strong>July 12, 1995</strong>, and welcomed over <strong>500,000 visitors</strong> in its first year.</p><br>

                    <p>Today, it receives more than <strong>1.5 million guests annually</strong>, including tourists, school groups, and nature lovers from all over the world.</p><br>

                    <p>We take pride in being one of the safest, cleanest, and most family-friendly zoos in the country.</p><br>

                    <p>One of our proudest achievements is the <strong>Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation Center</strong>, founded in <strong>2010</strong>.</p><br>

                    <p>It provides emergency care and shelter for injured or abandoned wild animals rescued from illegal trade or deforestation zones.</p><br>

                    <p>Many of these animals find permanent homes in our sanctuary areas.</p><br>

                    <p>Our mission is to create a bridge between people and wildlife — to remind everyone that every animal, big or small, plays an important role in nature’s balance.</p><br>

                    <p>We believe that by connecting with animals, we can learn to respect and protect the environment we all share.</p><br>

                    <p>Every corner of <strong>Zoo Park</strong> tells a story — from the roaring lion enclosure to the peaceful flamingo lake.</p><br>

                    <p>Each visit is a new adventure filled with discovery, excitement, and learning.</p><br>

                    <p>We invite families, students, and nature enthusiasts to explore, experience, and be inspired.</p><br>

                    <p>So come, walk through our green pathways, listen to the calls of the wild, and see the wonders of nature up close.</p><br>

                    <p>At <strong>Zoo Park</strong>, every visit supports conservation, every moment creates awareness, and every animal has a story to tell.</p>
