        <h3>About Kano</h3>
        <p>Kano is our impressive Nile crocodile and one of the oldest reptiles in the zoo. He was rescued in 2014 from the shores of Lake Victoria, where he was found injured by fishing equipment. Since then, Kano has recovered fully and become a star attraction in the Reptile Kingdom Zone.</p>

        <p>With his tough, armored skin and powerful jaws, Kano is a perfect example of nature’s ancient design. His stillness and patience make him a fascinating creature to observe, as he can stay motionless for hours waiting for the perfect moment to strike.</p>

        <p>Kano enjoys basking under the sun during the day and becomes more active during the evening. His enclosure includes both land and water areas to mimic his natural habitat. He often spends time half-submerged, with just his eyes and nostrils above the surface.</p>

        <p>He eats around three times a week, mainly a diet of fish, chicken, and specially prepared reptile meat. His diet is carefully balanced to maintain his weight and overall health. Kano is known for his powerful bite, one of the strongest in the animal kingdom.</p>

        <p>Despite his fierce appearance, Kano is calm around his caretakers and responds to feeding signals. He’s also part of our zoo’s reptile awareness program, teaching visitors about the role of crocodiles in maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems.</p>

        <p>During colder months, Kano enjoys basking under heat lamps and spends more time on land. In the summer, he loves the deeper pool area of his enclosure, where he can swim and stay cool for hours.</p>

        <p>Our veterinary team conducts regular health checkups to ensure his skin, teeth, and vision remain in excellent condition. Kano’s thick scales act as armor, protecting him from injuries and infections.</p>

        <p>Kano represents the strength, patience, and adaptability of crocodiles in the wild. His story of survival and recovery continues to educate and inspire visitors about the importance of preserving wetlands and protecting reptile species around the world.</p>
