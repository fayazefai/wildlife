            <h3>About Milo</h3>
            <p>Milo is one of the most energetic and intelligent animals at our zoo. Born in the rainforests of Central America, he joined us in 2020 and has since captured the hearts of visitors with his playful antics and lively spirit.</p>

            <p>As a Capuchin Monkey, Milo is known for his problem-solving skills and dexterous hands. He often uses tools like sticks to extract insects from tree bark or play with hanging ropes in his enclosure.</p>

            <p>Milo enjoys a balanced diet consisting of fresh fruits, nuts, vegetables, and protein sources like insects and eggs. His favorite treats are ripe bananas and peanuts, which he sometimes hides and digs up later!</p>

            <p>He spends most of his day swinging between branches, climbing ropes, and interacting with enrichment toys designed to challenge his mind. Visitors love watching his clever tricks and cheeky expressions.</p>

            <p>Milo shares his enclosure with two other Capuchins — Coco and Tiki. Together, they form a lively troop that spends hours grooming each other and exploring every corner of their forest area.</p>

            <p>During the afternoon, Milo usually takes a nap on his favorite tree perch, curled up in the shade. He’s most active during mornings and evenings, when he’s busy climbing, exploring, and showing off for visitors.</p>

            <p>He communicates through a variety of sounds and gestures — from chirps and squeaks to facial expressions that show curiosity or excitement. His caretakers describe him as clever, mischievous, and always full of energy.</p>

            <p>Milo is also part of the zoo’s animal enrichment program, which helps promote natural behaviors through puzzles, food challenges, and social interaction. This keeps him mentally and physically stimulated.</p>

            <p>Veterinary checkups show that Milo is in excellent health. His fur is thick and shiny, and his activity level is high. He continues to be a wonderful ambassador for rainforest wildlife and primate conservation.</p>

            <p>Milo’s intelligence and charisma make him one of the most fascinating animals to watch — a true favorite among families and children visiting our zoo.</p>
